# fault-prediction-for-smart-factory
- Developed a forecasting model for anomaly detection and fault prediction in a manufacturing process.

- The Dataset: SECOM Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository

- The process model: CRISP-DM.

- Challenges are limited amount of training data, unbalanced training data sets, uncertainty regarding which variables should be monitored, and uncertainty regarding how exactly historical data should be employed in the algorithmâ€™s training.

- Project presentation and full project report can be found in the main directory.
